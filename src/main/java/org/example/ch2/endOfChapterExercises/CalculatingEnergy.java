//    Science: calculating energy) Write a program that calculates the energy needed
//to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program
//should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial
//and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
// Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
// where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in
//degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules. Here is a sample run:
//Enter v0, v1, and t: 5.5 50.9 4.5
//The average acceleration is 10.0889
//Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
//Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
//Enter the final temperature: 10.5
//The energy needed is 1625484.0
