//    (Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
//speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
//take off using the following formula:
//length = v2
//2a
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
//acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2
//), then, displays the minimum runway length. Here is a sample run:
//Enter speed and acceleration: 60 3.5
//The minimum runway length for this airplane is 514.286
